# Report Writing Assistant ðŸš€

A multi-agent researcher system built with **langgraph** and specialized tools. This assistant orchestrates powerful web searching and advanced multi-step planning to help you gather and analyze information with ease. Whether youâ€™re exploring an academic topic, developing a business proposal, or crafting a technical document, this system will simplify your workflow from start to finish.

**Use local models or cloud-based services** â€” the choice is yours. Privacy, performance, and flexibility are our top priorities, so you can tailor this application to fit your unique needs.
